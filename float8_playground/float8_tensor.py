    A Python-only FP8 tensor.  Contains:
    * `_data`: the underlying e4m3 or e5m2 data
    * `_scale`: the scale used to scale the original fp32 tensor. We multiply
      by scale to go from fp32 range to fp8 range, and divide by scale to go
      from fp8 range to fp32 range.

    The current purpose of this object is 99% to bundle raw data + fp8 metadata
    together for easy passing through PyTorch systems, and 1% to implement
    gradient addition (since that has to happen outside of user code).

    The addition operation is defined inline and uses a naive
    version of stateless scaling. This allows e5m2 gradients to be added.
    TODO(future): verify this is numericaly accurate, optionally replace
    with something better.

    It would probably make sense to also define fp8 path for data shuffling
    ops like cat, transpose, view, etc inline so we don't have to fall back
    to fp32 for them.
